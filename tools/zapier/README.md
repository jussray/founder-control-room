# Zapier SDK tooling

This package keeps Zapier SDK access on a server-side developer boundary instead of adding it to the Founder Control Room runtime bundle.

## Local setup

Requirements: Node.js 20+ and a Zapier account with at least one connected app.

```bash
cd tools/zapier
npm install
npx skills add zapier/sdk -y
npm run login
npm run connections
npm run start
```

`npm run start` performs a read-only authentication check with `getProfile()`. It does not run an app action.

## Explore connected apps

```bash
npm run apps
npm run connections
npx zapier-sdk list-actions github
npx zapier-sdk list-actions hubspot
```

Generate TypeScript types only for integrations that are actually selected for implementation:

```bash
npx zapier-sdk add github hubspot --types-output ./src/generated
```

## Production credentials

Browser login is for local development. For a server or deployment, create approved client credentials locally:

```bash
npx zapier-sdk create-client-credentials "founder-control-room"
```

Store the returned values in the deployment secret manager as:

- `ZAPIER_CREDENTIALS_CLIENT_ID`
- `ZAPIER_CREDENTIALS_CLIENT_SECRET`

The bootstrap also supports an approved `ZAPIER_CREDENTIALS` direct token, but client credentials are preferred for server-side use.

Never commit `.env`, tokens, client secrets, generated connection output, or app data. Credential creation, rotation, deployment, and live write actions remain separate approval gates.
